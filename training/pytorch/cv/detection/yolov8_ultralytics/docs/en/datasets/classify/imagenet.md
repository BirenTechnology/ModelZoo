# ImageNet Dataset

[ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/) is a large-scale database of annotated images designed for use in visual object recognition research. It contains over 14 million images, with each image annotated using WordNet synsets, making it one of the most extensive resources available for training deep learning models in computer vision tasks.

## Key Features

- ImageNet contains over 14 million high-resolution images spanning thousands of object categories.
- The dataset is organized according to the WordNet hierarchy, with each synset representing a category.
- ImageNet is widely used for training and benchmarking in the field of computer vision, particularly for image classification and object detection tasks.
- The annual ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) has been instrumental in advancing computer vision research.

## Dataset Structure

The ImageNet dataset is organized using the WordNet hierarchy. Each node in the hierarchy represents a category, and each category is described by a synset (a collection of synonymous terms). The images in ImageNet are annotated with one or more synsets, providing a rich resource for training models to recognize various objects and their relationships.

## ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)

The annual [ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)](https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/) has been an important event in the field of computer vision. It has provided a platform for researchers and developers to evaluate their algorithms and models on a large-scale dataset with standardized evaluation metrics. The ILSVRC has led to significant advancements in the development of deep learning models for image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks.

## Applications

The ImageNet dataset is widely used for training and evaluating deep learning models in various computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and object localization. Some popular deep learning architectures, such as AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet, were developed and benchmarked using the ImageNet dataset.

## Usage

To train a deep learning model on the ImageNet dataset for 100 epochs with an image size of 224x224, you can use the following code snippets. For a comprehensive list of available arguments, refer to the model [Training](../../modes/train.md) page.

!!! Example "Train Example"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO("yolov8n-cls.pt")  # load a pretrained model (recommended for training)

        # Train the model
        results = model.train(data="imagenet", epochs=100, imgsz=224)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Start training from a pretrained *.pt model
        yolo train data=imagenet model=yolov8n-cls.pt epochs=100 imgsz=224
        ```
